# Mutual-Exclusion-Banking-System
Created a program that uses a mutual exclusion algorithm for a bank scenario  where many depositors and clients are able to process transactions to and from bank accounts concurrently. Uses Linux and C which protects against multi-user threading fraud by employing the mutex synchronization primitive to prevent simultaneous shared data access.
