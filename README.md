# Mutual-Exclusion-Banking-System
Created a program that uses a mutual exclusion algorithm for a bank scenario  where many depositors and clients are able to process transactions to and from bank accounts concurrently. The program uses Linux and C which protects against multi-user threading fraud by employing the [mutex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex#:~:text=The%20mutex%20class%20is%20a,try_lock%20until%20it%20calls%20unlock%20.) synchronization primitive to prevent simultaneous shared data access.
